This file describes the other files contained in this folder.

part1.h
    This file just includes the define variables and the structs used in my parts of the project.

part1.c
    This file runs exactly like the piazza post says. It makes a topic queue and fills, empties, and prints, and getsentries as per spec. It prints out examples of what it is running.

part2.c 
    This file was a work in progress of part2. I made threads and added to my part1 implementation. I couldn't get much to work completely and didn't know how I should show what I got working. Started threads publisher, subscriber, and delete for cleanup.

Makefile:
    built off of the given makefile. Added ways to make part1 and part2. (ex. just "make part1")


To evaluate code: for part1, jsut run it. Main has the prints and examples of what is running.
    
    for part2, main again fills in whats going on. It only prints when it is inside of the threads/threads are running though. It prints the entries the subscriber is reading currently.


I have run all the code I have explained on Arch VM

I finished part1 and most of part2. Just didn't get the details of part2 completed completely.
